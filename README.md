# DriverPass Project Reflection

## Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client who runs a driving instruction business. The client wanted a system that would allow students to take online practice exams and schedule on-the-road driving lessons. The goal was to build a system that supports both digital learning and in-person scheduling, while also meeting the administrative needs of the business.

## What I Did Well
One area I did particularly well was gathering and organizing the business requirements clearly. I was able to translate client needs into a structured document that laid the foundation for the system design. I also ensured the UML diagrams were clearly labeled and followed proper notation.

## What I Would Revise
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the sequence diagram for the “Schedule Driving Lesson” use case. Initially, some of the interactions lacked clarity and didn’t reflect real-world constraints like availability checks. I would revise the diagram to show more detailed flows.

## How I Interpreted and Implemented User Needs
I interpreted the user's needs by carefully analyzing the business model and breaking each requirement into specific system functions. I implemented them into the system design by creating diagrams and workflows that match how users interact with the system. Considering the user's needs is critical to building a system that is functional and user-friendly.

## How I Approach Designing Software
When designing software, I start by understanding the problem and breaking it into smaller parts. I use techniques like UML modeling, creating user stories, and requirement prioritization. In the future, I plan to incorporate more Agile strategies, like prototyping and early feedback, to improve my designs.
